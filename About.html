            <h1>About me</h1>
    <p> Hello there! I'm Yasmin Hassan, a computer science student, at University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC) focusing on security and network engineering. My studies have equipped me with an understanding of programming languages, data structures and network basics.
        I find the field of cloud security intriguing due to its challenges and opportunities given the increasing need to safeguard systems in our interconnected world. My aim is to contribute to creating more efficient cloud environments.
<p></p>
        Although I'm still early in my career I've already covered computer science topics like cybersecurity, software engineering and artificial intelligence through coursework. I actively seek chances to apply my knowledge in situations and enhance my skills in security and network engineering.
        I anticipate graduating with a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science by May 2024.
        <p></p> Post graduation I aspire to specialize in cloud security, possibly pursuing industry certifications.
        
        My career aspirations involve working on projects in cloud security collaborating with industry experts and eventually becoming a figure in secure cloud infrastructures. Additionally, I'm dedicated to promoting diversity, in the tech field and inspiring students to explore cybersecurity careers.
